* mean time to reach full coverage (e.g. time to reach 90%)
    * compare all algorithms divided by terrain
* mean coverage reached after time (e.g. coverage reached after 30 minutes)
    * compare all algorithms divided by terrain
* mean number of revisits to reach full coverage
    * compare all terrains divided by algorithms
* mean time between visits to reach full coverage
    * compare all terrains divided by algorithms
* standard deviation of revisits to reach full coverage
    * compare all terrains divided by algorithms
* standard deviation of time between visits to reach full coverage
    * compare all terrains divided by algorithms
